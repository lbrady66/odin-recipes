        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Easy to make and refreshingly bitter, the Negroni is said to have been invented in Florence by the dauntless Italian Count Camillo Negroni in the early 20th century. While at Bar Casoni in Florence, he demanded that the bartender strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano, by replacing the usual soda water with gin. To further differentiate the drink, the bartender also employed an orange peel rather than the typical lemon peel.</p>
