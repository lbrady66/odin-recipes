        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>“I love the simplicity of it: this olive dressing on green-leaf lettuce. That’s it!” says Matty Matheson, the executive chef of Parts & Labour. “The very first time I went to my future wife’s house for dinner, her mom served this salad. It was perfect. And I’m a guy who hates salads (not because of the vegetables, but because no one knows how to make a proper salad). Salads should be good lettuce with good, light dressing, not every vegetable in the world shredded and covered in poppy seed-honey dressing with a cup of granola or something.”</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup pitted Cerignola olives</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
            <li>Zest and juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>1/2  cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 shallot, diced</li>
            <li>1 bunch parsley, leaves chopped</li>
            <li>3 Tbps white vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Green-leaf lettuce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, pulse olives, garlic, green onion, lemon zest and juive, and olive oil multiple times until it becomes frothy and lumpy, like a tapenade. Keep pulsing- don't just leave it on blend; you don't want it to emulsify. Pour into bowl.</li>
            <li>Add shallot and parsley to your dressing, then add vinegar and canola oil. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve dressing atop crunchy, well-washed green-leaf lettuce (little gem works well, too.</li>
        </ol>
